\title{Prepare distinct building blocks, from which the data.frames for the plot-functions can be build by combining them.}
\usage{
prep_data_blocks(data_clean, sig_niveau, states, sub_groups, merging_columns)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_clean}{Input data.frame, that has already been cleaned with \code{\link[=clean_data]{clean_data()}}.}

\item{sig_niveau}{Numeric indicating the border below which p-values will be considered significant. Defaults to \code{0.05}.}

\item{states}{Character vector of the different states (Bundesl√§nder) found in the data.}

\item{sub_groups}{Character vector of the different groups found in \code{grouping_var}.}

\item{merging_columns}{Columns that won't get a suffix.}
}
\value{
\code{prep_data_blocks()} returns a list containing five data.frames which can be used as the building blocks for more specific data.frames needed for the \code{plot()} functions. These data.frames contain distinct information, and can be combined according to the requirements of the respective plots. The returned list includes the data.frames:
\itemize{
\item \code{noTrend_noComp} contains point estimates for every years.
\item \code{Trend_Comp} contains all trend variables performing some kind of comparison, e.g., state vs. germany.
\item \code{trend_no_comp_data} contains the trend estimates without comparisons.
\item \code{noTrend_noComp_wholeGroup} contains the point estimates of the wholeGroup.
\item \code{Trend_noComp_wholeGroup} contains the trend estimates for the wholeGroup.
