\title{Round a numeric vector so it sums exactly to 100}
\usage{
round_preserve_100(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector whose elements approximately sum to 100
(within c(99, 101)). Values should be finite and typically non-negative.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the same length as \code{x}, with integer values that
sum to exactly 100.
}
\description{
Floors values and then distributes the remaining units to the entries with
the largest fractional parts (the “largest remainders” method) so that the
final vector sums to exactly 100.
}
\examples{
round_preserve_100(c(33.4, 33.3, 33.3))
round_preserve_100(c(12.9, 12.1, 25.5, 49.5))

# Edge case: already sums to 100
round_preserve_100(c(10, 20, 30, 40))

# Will error if far from 100:
\dontrun{
round_preserve_100(c(10, 10, 10))  # sum = 30
}
