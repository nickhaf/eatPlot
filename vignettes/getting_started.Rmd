`eatPlot` takes output data frames from `eatRep` and facilitates the construction of different `ggplot2`-plots for the data. Main goal is the plotting of BT22 graphs, but in general the package can be used for other purposes as well. 
The package's aim is it to make the plotting as easy but flexible as possible, so let's dive right in!

# Basic workflow
## Data preperation
The first step is the data preparation. This is handled by the function `prep_plot()`:
```{r}
dat_plot <- prep_plot(trend_books,
  competence = "GL",
  grouping_vars = "KBuecher_imp3"
)
```
The only thing that needs to be done in this step is to define the columns in your data set (here named "trend_books"), if they differ from the defaults, so the function knows which on is which.
(I don't fully understand this sentence)

The result is a list consisting of different data frames, each data frame containing the prepared data for a different plot type. Normally, you don't have to look at this list, but in some cases you might want to edit the data by hand to fit your purpose.

This concludes the basic data preparation workflow. Consult `vignette("data_preperation")` or `prep_plot()` for further information. 


## Plotting
Different predefined plot types stemming from the BT22 graphs are available. In general, the `eatPlot`-functions can also be combined to create additional plots, however, the functions have been optimized in regards to the BT22-needs.
Each plot function consists of two parts: 

1) The function arguments, which mainly specify the data columns that should be plotted.
2) An additional argument called `plot_settings`, which takes a plot settings function, used for specifying graphical features like colours, font sizes etc. 

### Plot settings
Plot settings can be defined by a list with a specific format, which is generated by `plotsettings_lineplot()` or `plotesettings_tablebarplot()`.
Additionally, multiple default lists for different plot types have already been built and are included within `eatPlot`. See `vignette("plot_settings")` for further instructions on altering your own plots. 

### Lineplots
Line plots are plotted using the `plot_lineplot()` function. Input data is the list of data.frames prepared by `prep_plot()`. 

```{r}
plot_lineplot(dat_plot,
  years_lines = list(c(2011, 2016), c(2016, 2021)),
  years_braces = list(c(2011, 2016), c(2016, 2021))
)
```
As we can see, the line plot doesn't look optimal yet. However, we can provide the predefined plotsettings-list to get the anticipated result:

```{r}
p1 <- plot_lineplot(dat_plot,
  years_lines = list(c(2011, 2016), c(2016, 2021)),
  years_braces = list(c(2011, 2016), c(2016, 2021)),
  plot_settings = lineplot_4x4
)
p1
```

The plots might still look a bit distorted, as they are optimized for the saved pdf file. You can save the plot by using `save_plot()`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
save_plot(p1, filename = "./p1.pdf")
```
This already sets the correct widths and heights for the final output. 

### Tables and barplots
As often both tables and bar plots need to be combined to the same plot, the function `plot_tablebar()` is responsible for both operations. 

The function takes either the whole list-object generated by `prep_plot()` or the according data frame `plot_tablebar`. This way, you can extract and edit the `plot_tablebar` data frame yourself.

When we have cleaned our data, we can plot a tablebarplot by providing variables that should be plotted as table columns, as well as the headers, and default settings (if needed). 
```{r}
dat_plot <- subset(dat_plot$plot_tablebar, grouping_var == 0)

bartable_1 <- plot_tablebar(
  dat = dat_plot,
  bar_est = "est_Trend_Comp_crossDiff_wholeGroup_20162021",
  headers = list("Land", "Wert", "Bar"),
  columns_table = c("state_var", "est_noTrend_noComp_2016"),
  y_axis = "state_var",
  plot_settings = plotsettings_tablebarplot(
    axis_x_lims = c(-30, 30),
    columns_alignment = c(0, 0.5),
    columns_width = c(0.2, 0.1, 0.7),
    default_list = barplot_plot_frame
  )
)
```
Note that we have to change the column alignment here, so the column values are aligned correctly, and that we have to change the column width, if we don't want all columns to have the same size.   


### Combining tables and barplots
Currently, `eatPlot` only supports the generation of a table with the desired number of columns, and one bar plot on the right side of the table. For very complex plots, different plots have to be combined to achieve the desired output. 

```{r}
bartable_2 <- plot_tablebar(
  dat = dat_plot,
  bar_est = "est_Trend_Comp_crossDiff_wholeGroupSameGroup_20162021",
  headers = list("Wert", "Bar"),
  columns_table = c("est_noTrend_noComp_2021"),
  y_axis = "state_var",
  plot_settings = plotsettings_tablebarplot(
    axis_x_lims = c(-20, 20),
    columns_alignment = 0.5,
    columns_width = c(0.2, 0.8),
    default_list = barplot_plot_frame
  )
)
```
Sometimes the alignment of the columns can be a bit tricky, then you have to play around with the `columns_alignment`, `columns_width` and `columns_nudge` settings.

The two plots can be combined into one by `combine_plots()`:

```{r}
combine_plots(list(bartable_1, bartable_2))
```
